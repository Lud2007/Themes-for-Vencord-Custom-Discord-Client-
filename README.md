# Themes-for-Vencord-Custom-Discord-Client-
These are some themes I made using a software by the developer Gibbu.
Main editor used: https://bdeditor.dev/
Resources and their Developers:
- https://discordstyles.github.io/FrostedGlass/dist/FrostedGlass.css
- https://mwittrien.github.io/BetterDiscordAddons/Themes/ServerColumns/ServerColumns.css
- https://discordstyles.github.io/Addons/windows-titlebar.css

  note: I am NOT the creator of any of these resources. I simply used these to create my own custom themes. All credit goes to those who made them.
